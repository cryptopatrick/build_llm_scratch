I'm reading the book, "Build a Large Language Model from Scratch".
It's an excellent book, written by author Sebastian Raschka. 

This repo contains the notes, and snippets of code written, I'm taking while
studying the book.

Please note: 
the book has a github repo of its own. Go check it out!
And make sure to BUY THE BOOK!
It's absolutely amazing!
