I'm reading the "Build a Large Language Model from Scratch", the excellent book 
by author Sebastian Raschka. This repo contains notes and snippets of code written
while studying the book.

Please note: the book has a github repo of its own. Go check it out!
And make sure to BUY THE BOOK! It's absolutely amazing!
